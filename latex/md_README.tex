This Library contains support for a R\+C522 chip and a M\+I\+F\+A\+RE 1K card version M\+F1\+S503yX.

It is relatively easily expandable to support other chip using S\+PI or even I2C or U\+A\+RT.

You can also implement support for more M\+I\+F\+A\+RE card versiona and even other cards.

With some minor adjustments you can also support different games using character sheets.
