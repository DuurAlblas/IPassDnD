This Library contains support for a RC522 chip and a MIFARE 1K card version MF1S503yX.

It is relatively easily expandable to support other chip using SPI or even I2C or UART.

You can also implement support for more MIFARE card versiona and even other cards.

With some minor adjustments you can also support different games using character sheets.
